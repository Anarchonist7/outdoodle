SCENARIOS:

Given an event link
When a user opens it
Then it direct them to the signup page

Given a list of available timeslots
When a user clicks the timeslot(s)
Then the page should clearly display which slots have been selected

If I enter an email/name that has already been attached to the current event
Then I should be notified that this email/name is already attached to this event

Given an idea to create an event, whe an admin proposes the timeslot options for the event to take place, the


TIMELINE PROGRESSION:
1. Admin enters name and email
2. Admin will be prompted to enter event details, which include (name, proposed timeslots, template/category, attendee limit)
3. Admin creates an initial event (event status will be unconfirmed) and recieves their unique link to edit/comment/etc
4. Link is generated and admin can share via their own communication workflow (slack etc)
5. Users recieve the link which takes them to the event page where they will be prompted to enter their name and email and availability (this info will enter the database)
6. Users will be automatically redirected to a secret link which is unique to them (they will use this from now on to access the event, they will also recieve an email with this link)
7. Admin can confirm the event time based on user availability and upon confirmation, attendees will be notified via email and prompted for addittional confirmation and the event page updated (event status = confirmed)
